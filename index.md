## CS 3220: Processor Design 

In this course, we will study hardware implementation of architecture design. This is an intermediate-level course that follows CS2200. This course is a project-based course in which you will learn pipelined architectures by actually implementing simple instructions using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) board. 

**Course Description**

 The course will strengthen the background knowledge of processor design by understanding timing issues, critical path, and other underlying hardware structures. It will also provide an understanding of architecture, system, assembly programming and increase programming and debugging skills. 

 **Topics:**

- Hardware description language (Verilog)

- FPGA programming 

- FPGA testing 

- Digital design 

- Pipeline design 

- Processor architecture 

- Modern processors

- FPGA programming with High-level synthesis

- Compiler backgrounds 

- Accelerators for emerging workloads

- Pynq Boards

- Xilinx & Altera FPGA development tools

- High-Level Synthesis
